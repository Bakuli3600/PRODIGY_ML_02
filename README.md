Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.
*********************************************************************

This Python implementation uses the K-means clustering algorithm to group retail customers based on their purchase history, utilizing features like gender, age, annual income, and spending score. The code preprocesses the data by encoding categorical variables, standardizing numerical features, and employing the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters. It then applies the K-means algorithm and visualizes the resulting clusters through a scatter plot, enabling insightful segmentation of customer behavior. This approach is valuable for understanding and optimizing customer engagement strategies in retail environments.
